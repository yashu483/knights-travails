## About

Given these arguments , function returns array describing shortest path from current position of knight to given end position

- Use function knightMoves(start,end) in console. The function is added as method to global window, so you can use it in console.
-  knightMoves([0,0],[7,7])   returns    [[0,0], [1,2], [3,1], [2,3], [3,5], [5,6], [7,7]]
